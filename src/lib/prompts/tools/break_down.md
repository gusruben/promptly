## Break down

Break down the problem into multiple smaller tasks to be solved by subordinates. This tool is very powerful and should be used frequently, as long as the scope of the problem might require more than one tool. Instruct your subordinate in detail what they should accomplish and the role they should take on. Always give detailed instructions and be very descriptive and specific, as well as information about the higher goal. Never delegate your entire task, only small parts.

This tool only takes one argument: `task`, the task for the subordinate to complete and any other details.
